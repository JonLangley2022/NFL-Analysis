NFL analysis made by Sujeet Yeramareddy, Jonathan Langlry , Yong Liu


For our 180B project, my group decided to use our domain methodology of postpi (post prediction inference) 
and apply it to sports analysis based on NFL games.  We are designing a model that can predict the outcome
 of a football game, such as which team will win and what the margin of their victory will be, and then 
 correcting the statistical inference for selected key features.
